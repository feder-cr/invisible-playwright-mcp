"""Sessions, owned here rather than by whoever happens to be connected.

The server used to hold one session in a module global and close it when the
client went away. That made the browser a property of the connection, which
blocked three things at once: only one client could ever attach, the session
could not outlive the process that served it, and nothing but a tool call could
reach the page.

So sessions live here, keyed by id, and a client is just something that borrows
one. Closing happens when the process shuts down, or when someone asks - not
when a client disconnects.

        A start that FAILS must not poison the id. The original bug here stored
        the session before awaiting `start()`, so a start that raised left a
        half-built object behind: every later call found something non-None,
        skipped the start, and died on `'NoneType' object has no attribute ...`,
        an error that names nothing and, on a stdio server, ended the whole
        conversation. The two ways to hit it are ordinary - a stale
        INVISIBLE_SEAL_FILE, and a proxy that is down when the first tool runs.

        So a session is stored only once it has actually started.

        ⛔ AND A REBUILD IS THE SAME PERSON, WHICH IS WHY `_configs` EXISTS.
        Every browsing tool runs through `_retrying`, which on any exception
        drops the session and calls this again. Building the replacement from
        the environment - what this did until now - meant one timeout silently
        replaced the caller's seed, profile AND PROXY with whatever the shell
        happened to hold, so the traffic left from the host's own address while
        the tool reported success. A dead browser between two calls is the
        ordinary case here, so the common path was the one that deanonymised.

        A remembered exit that is DOWN now makes the rebuild fail twice instead
        of succeeding without it. That is the intended trade: a suppressed
        signal is a failure, not a pass, and failing loudly beats succeeding
        from the wrong address.
