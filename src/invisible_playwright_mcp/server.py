"""MCP server exposing browser_* tools over stealth sessions.

Tool names mirror the Microsoft Playwright MCP so prompts stay portable.
Config comes from STEALTHFOX_* env vars; a session starts lazily on first use.

Every tool here is a wrapper. The operations live in `actions.py` and the
sessions live in `registry.py`, so every client drives the browser through
exactly the same code rather than through a second implementation that would
drift from this one.

Transport is stdio by default, which is what existing clients expect. Set
STEALTHFOX_MCP_TRANSPORT=http to serve over streamable HTTP instead, which is
what lets more than one client attach to the same live browser.

THERE IS NO INTERFACE HERE, and that is the point rather than an omission. This
package served a two-pane page and a live view until 0.9.0, reaching the browser
through `registry` because it was in the same process. Both moved to `aihawk`,
which now reaches the browser over MCP like anybody else. What that buys is not
tidiness: it means no client has a privileged path, so the tools below are
provably sufficient for the flagship interface, because the flagship interface
is a client of them. A page kept inside the server is a page whose needs quietly
become the server's requirements.

# nothing had told it they were rungs.
INSTRUCTIONS = """Drive the page the way a person would. Everything here goes
through the real pointer and the real keyboard.

Try things in this order. It matters, because a page can tell the difference.

1. A named tool with a selector: browser_click, browser_type,
   browser_select_option, browser_press_key. browser_snapshot gives you the
   selector for each element - pass it verbatim, it is built to be unambiguous.

2. Coordinates. browser_snapshot reports `at: [x, y]` for every element it
   lists, in viewport pixels. browser_click_at takes exactly those and moves the
   pointer there. This is the rung for anything a selector does not describe: a
   canvas, a slider, a map, a custom widget built out of divs.

3. Your eyes. browser_take_screenshot, find the thing in the picture, then
   browser_click_at on where it is. For what the snapshot does not list at all.

4. browser_evaluate, to READ what none of the above can see.

browser_evaluate refuses the obvious ways to act on the page, and names the tool
to use instead: assigning to value, checked or selected, or calling click(),
dispatchEvent(), submit() or requestSubmit(). All of those skip the keyboard and
the pointer, so the event arrives with isTrusted false - the single clearest
signal that something other than a person is driving, and avoiding it is what
this browser is for. When you want that, rung 2 or rung 3 is what you actually
want.

That refusal is a guardrail on the obvious road, not a wall around the field.
JavaScript has unlimited ways to say the same thing and this catches the ones
worth catching, so DO NOT read a silent pass as permission: if you find a way to
change the page through browser_evaluate, that is the bug, and saying so in your
answer is worth more than using it.

You do not need script to read state back, either. The snapshot carries
`checked` for a checkbox or radio and `value` for a select, alongside the text.

If you get to the bottom of the ladder and still cannot do the thing, say so in
your answer. A task reported as impossible is worth more than a task completed
in a way that gets the session blocked."""
