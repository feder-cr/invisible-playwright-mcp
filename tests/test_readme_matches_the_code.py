"""The README describes this package. These check that it still describes THIS one.

Written 2026-09-02, after finding that the HTTP transport, the live view and the
two-pane chat had shipped in 0.4.0 and were named nowhere in the README: not
broken, just invisible, which is the same thing from the outside. The view and
the chat left for `aihawk` the same day, so the drift to watch for here is now
the opposite one - a README still offering pages this package stopped serving.

Documentation drift is silent by construction. Nothing fails, nothing is red, and
the gap only surfaces when somebody asks for a feature that has been there for a
month. So the two facts most likely to drift are checked against the code that
defines them rather than against anybody's memory.
