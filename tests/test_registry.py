"""A start that fails must not take the rest of the conversation with it.

This is the defect that made the server unusable in practice: the session was
stored BEFORE `start()` was awaited, so a start that raised left a half-built
object behind. Every later call then found something non-None, skipped the
start, and died on `'NoneType' object has no attribute ...` - an error that
names nothing and, on a stdio server, ends the session.

These tests moved here from test_ensure_session.py when the module global became
a registry. What they protect did not change: they still fail against a registry
that stores a session before it has started, or that hands back a dead one, or
that rebuilds a healthy one.
